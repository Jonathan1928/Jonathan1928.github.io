        "description": "Guided by MATLAB’s OnRamps Astronomy Spectroscopy module, I developed a MATLAB script to measure stellar velocities via the Doppler shift of the Hydrogen-alpha absorption line.\n\nI began by importing wavelength-vs-intensity spectra for seven stars and plotting each spectrum. Using MATLAB’s min function, I identified the Hα trough—where hydrogen atoms absorb most strongly—and compared its observed wavelength (λₒᵦₛ) to the laboratory reference of 656.28 nm.\n\nI then computed the fractional shift,\n\nz = (λₒᵦₛ/656.28nm) -1\n\nand the corresponding radial speed,\n\nv = z x C\n\nA positive z (λₒᵦₛ > 656.28 nm) indicates redshift (receding), while a negative z (λₒᵦₛ < 656.28 nm) indicates blueshift (approaching).\n\nBy looping through each star’s data structure with for and if logic, the code automatically extracted, analyzed, and classified all spectra. Finally, I overlaid the results on a single plot—using bold solid lines for redshifted stars and dashed lines for blueshifted ones—to provide a clear visual summary of stellar motion relative to Earth.",
